This Project was a small effort to do automation of testing for Microsoft Dynamics Cloud application using Selenium with no additional tools.
Code is not in perfect shape as it was more a trial version. 
Used firefox extensions for HTML debug.
Also noticed that Microsoft Dynamics Cloud has inherently complex HTML to navigate and fetch elements. Got desired results after multiple iterations.
